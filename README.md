## How to download YT Downloader
This section will show you how to install YT Downloader.

### Downloading the requirements
First, we'll start with downloading the requirements. The main requirement is of course, [Python](https://www.python.org), and the following modules:

```
customtkinter
pytube
```

You can download the modules by typing the following in the Terminal:  

``pip3 install customtkinter``  
``pip3 install pytube``  

If the commands didn't work, you can try using using ``pip`` instead of ``pip3``.  
If it still didn't work, try reinstalling Python, and tick the "Add to PATH" box.  

*Now that you're done with the requirements, you can move onto downloading yt-downloader itself.*

``python script.pyw``
