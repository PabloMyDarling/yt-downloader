## How to download YT Downloader
This section will show you how to install YT Downloader.

First, we'll start with downloading the requirements. The main requirement is of course, [Python](https://www.python.org), and the following modules:

```
customtkinter
pytube
```

To download these modules, you can download the modules by typing ``pip3 install customtkinter`` and ``pip3 install pytube`` in the Terminal.
If the commands didn't work, you can try using using ``pip`` instead of ``pip3``
If it still didn't work, try reinstalling Python, and tick the "Add to PATH" box.
